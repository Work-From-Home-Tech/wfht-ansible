# Work From Home Tech Useful Ansible
Work from home tech ansible roles and playbooks.

## Roles

Container roles will always install as docker compose files in the /opt/stacks directory for compatability with dockage prefered usage. This makes things easily consistent and accessible from the Dockage GUI.

## Using wfht-ansible
1) clone the wfh-ansible repository
2) Add the wfht-ansible/roles directory to your $HOME/.ansible/ansibl.cfg file role path
3) Use the test file for each role as an example playbook

### tailscale
